<h1>Welcome to the Nodes UI Framework</h1>

<p>The documentation is still a work in progress, and currently we are focusing all our efforts on implementing the actual code instad of documenting it. Please bear with us.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>We have a few rules you absolutely need to adhere to if you want to contribute to the Nodes UI Framework:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        ANY styleguide specific component must be styled by using a prefixed class ie.: <code>class="docs--my-styleguide-button"</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure to follow existing pages markup structure. Especially xray-html is a little tricky.
    </li>
    <li>
        If your example requires some specific styling, write that in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> directly in the document.
    </li>
</ul>
